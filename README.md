# RGB-D Human Matting Project
This is the official introduction of HDM-2K Dataset RGB-D Human Matting.
## HDM-2K Dataset
In order to promote the RGB-D human matting research, the first RGB-D human matting dataset, HDM-2K, is established in our paper(RGB-D Human Matting). The HDM-2K dataset is comprised of real-world human images from various scenes, helpful depth maps,and manually annotated alpha mattes. After the paper is accepted, we will release this dataset for encouraging future academic research on human matting. 
## RGB-D Human Matting Paper
In this paper, we proposed a novel matting method, RGB-D human matting, which achieves the prediction of human alpha matte in various real-world scenes.
