# RGB-D Human Matting
This is the official introduction of HDM-2K dataset.
## HDM-2K Dataset
In order to promote the RGB-D human matting research, the first RGB-D human matting dataset, HDM-2K, is established in this paper(RGB-D Human Matting). The HDM-2K dataset is comprised of real-world human images from various scenes, helpful depth maps,and manually annotated alpha mattes. After the paper is accepted, we will release this dataset for encouraging future academic research on human matting.
